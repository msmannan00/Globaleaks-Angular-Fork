"context of GlobaLeaks, by default no automatic metadata cleanup is "
"implemented because metadata is considered fundamental part of the "
"original evidence that shall be preserved and not invalidated. For this "
"reason metadata cleanup is an optional operation that could be suggested "
"to Whistleblowers or operated by Recipients when sharing the document "
"with other persons. When sharing files to external third parties "
"Recipients are invited to print the document and provide a hard copy. "
"This process is helpful to ensure that recipients only share what they "
"see without risking to share sensitive information contained in the "
"metadata of the files of which they may not be aware of. To get to know "
"more about metadata and the best practices on redacting metadata from "
