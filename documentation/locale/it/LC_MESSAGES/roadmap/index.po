"GlobaLeaks implements by-design many best practices in matters of privacy"

"GDPR compliance / ISO certifications / etc.); among all we selected that "
"GDPR compliance is a first step where the software could implement best "
"practices (e.g. procedures for self signup should present appropriate "
"legal notices, terms of services, and contractualization). Within the "
"software, there should be implemented an automatic contract generation "
"via PDF or other suitable formats in respect with the GDPR requirements."

"Part of the software is a recent feature of Multitenancy, first "

"GlobaLeaks makes it possible to create multiple setups of itself via "
"virtual sites (similarly to Wordpress multisite feature). In order to "
"make it more easy for an administrator to migrate a platform form a "
"system to an other or to enable users to require data portability from a "
"globaleaks provider to an other, for example in relation to GDPR it has "
"been evaluated necessary to improve the multi tenancy implementation by "
"implementing support for import-export of tenants. In the context of a "
"whistleblowing application, involving encryption and logging this poses "
"important challenges on how to best handle this process."

"Important requirement at the base of the Multitenancy expansion is the "
